Resources for development of structured reporting templates.

NOTE: All examples in this repository are just that, examples. Nothing in this repository should be used directly in production.

## Getting started
To use the examples in this repository you need node.js and webpack.

### Installing node.js
Go to the official website for node.js and download and install the latest stable version.

### Installing webpack globally
Webpack is used to "compile" typescript into javascript and for bundling all javascript into one file.
1. Open a command prompt and execute <em>npm install -g webpack</em>
2. Execute <em>npm install -g webpack-cli</em>
