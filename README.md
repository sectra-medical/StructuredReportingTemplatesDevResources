# StructuredReportingTemplatesDevResources
Resources for development of structured reporting templates.

NOTE: All examples in this repository are just that, examples. Nothing in this repository should be used directly in production.

## Getting started
To use the examples in this repository you need node.js.

### Installing node.js
Go to the official website for node.js and download and install the latest stable version.

### Building templates
1. Open a command prompt in the template root folder
2. Execute npm install
3. Execute npm run build

The build is then created in the dist folder. The HTML file in that folder can now be imported into Sectra IDS7.
